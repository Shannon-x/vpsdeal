- Rate limiting for submissions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema (2 hours)
- Create comments table

- GET /api/comments/:vpsId - Get comments for VPS
- PUT /api/admin/comments/:id - Moderate comment
- DELETE /api/admin/comments/:id - Delete comment
- Implement captcha verification
- Add rate limiting middleware

### 3. Frontend Components (6 hours)
- CommentList.vue - Display comments

- Captcha integration component
- Admin moderation interface

### 4. Testing & Integration (2 hours)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Comments can be submitted anonymously

## Notes
