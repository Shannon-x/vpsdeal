# Task: Database Optimization for Complete Platform

## Description
Add necessary database tables and fields to support comments, price history tracking, and multi-language content. This includes creating new tables for user comments and price history, and adding translated_fields column to vps table for storing translations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comments table created with proper schema (id, vps_id, user_id, content, created_at, status)
- [ ] Price history table created with proper schema (id, vps_id, price, date, currency)
- [ ] Translated_fields column added to vps table (JSON type for storing translations)
- [ ] Database migration scripts created and tested
- [ ] Indexes added for optimal query performance

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create SQL migration scripts for new tables and columns
- Key considerations: Ensure backward compatibility, proper indexing for performance
- Code locations/files affected: 
  - `/opt/vps/database/schema.sql`
  - `/opt/vps/server/db.js`
  - `/opt/vps/server/init-db.js`

## Dependencies
- [ ] MySQL database connection available
- [ ] No conflicting database migrations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Migration scripts implemented
- [ ] Tables created successfully in database
- [ ] Database connection layer updated to support new tables
- [ ] Tests written for database operations
- [ ] Documentation updated with new schema
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
