# Task: Data Collection Enhancement with Translation Support

## Description
Extend the enhanced-crawler.js to support automatic translation of VPS data and implement deduplication logic. The crawler should detect content language, translate when necessary, and avoid duplicate entries while maintaining data quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Language detection implemented for scraped content
- [ ] Translation pipeline integrated into crawler workflow
- [ ] Deduplication logic prevents duplicate VPS entries
- [ ] Batch processing supports translation queue
- [ ] Error handling for translation failures
- [ ] Translation results cached in database

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Enhance existing crawler with translation middleware
- Key considerations: Rate limiting for translation API, batch processing efficiency
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/opt/vps/server/crawler/enhanced-crawler.js`
  - `/opt/vps/server/crawler/providers/`
  - `/opt/vps/server/utils/translation.js` (new file)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database optimization task completed (2)
- [ ] Translation service API credentials available
- [ ] Redis available for caching

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Language detection integrated into crawler
- [ ] Translation pipeline implemented and tested
- [ ] Deduplication logic prevents duplicates
- [ ] Translation errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance metrics show acceptable crawl times
- [ ] Tests cover translation and deduplication scenarios
