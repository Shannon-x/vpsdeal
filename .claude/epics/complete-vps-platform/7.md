### 2. Backend Search API (8 hours)
- POST /api/search - Advanced search endpoint
- GET /api/search/suggest - Autocomplete
- GET /api/search/popular - Popular searches
- Implement Pinyin search logic
- Add search result ranking algorithm
- Cache frequent searches in Redis

### 3. Frontend Implementation (6 hours)
- AdvancedSearch.vue - Search interface
- SearchFilters.vue - Filter sidebar
- SearchSuggestions.vue - Autocomplete
- Search state management
- Search history localStorage
- Mobile-optimized search UI

### 4. Testing & Optimization (2 hours)
- Chinese search test cases
- Pinyin conversion tests
- Performance benchmarking
- Search relevance tuning
- Load testing for concurrent searches

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Chinese keywords return accurate results
- [ ] Pinyin search works correctly
- [ ] Filters can be combined with search
- [ ] Autocomplete provides relevant suggestions
- [ ] Search performs under 100ms for common queries

## Notes

- Add search shortcuts (e.g., "香港VPS" -> location:HK)
- Consider Meilisearch as alternative to Elasticsearch
- Cache popular search combinations aggressively
