# Task: Translation Service Integration with Caching

## Description
Create a robust translation service wrapper that interfaces with translation APIs (Google Translate, DeepL, etc.), implements Redis caching for translation results, and provides batch translation capabilities. The service should be reusable across the platform for both crawler and frontend needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Translation service wrapper supports multiple providers
- [ ] Redis caching layer reduces API calls by 80%
- [ ] Batch translation processes up to 100 items efficiently
- [ ] Fallback mechanism when primary provider fails
- [ ] API rate limiting prevents quota exceeded errors
- [ ] Translation quality monitoring implemented

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create modular translation service with provider abstraction
- Key considerations: API key rotation, cost optimization, cache invalidation strategy
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/opt/vps/server/utils/translation-service.js` (new file)
  - `/opt/vps/server/utils/translation-providers/` (new directory)
  - `/opt/vps/server/redis.config.js`
  - `/opt/vps/server/api/translate.js` (new API endpoint)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Redis server available and configured
- [ ] Translation API credentials (Google/DeepL)
- [ ] Database schema supports translated fields (2)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Translation service implemented with provider abstraction
- [ ] Redis caching layer fully functional
- [ ] Batch translation tested with 100+ items
- [ ] API rate limiting prevents quota issues
- [ ] Fallback mechanism tested and documented
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 90% coverage
- [ ] API endpoint documented with examples
